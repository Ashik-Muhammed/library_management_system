# library_management_system
It is an implementation of a Library Management System using the tkinter library in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing books in a library.

When the program starts, a login screen is displayed where users can enter their username and password. If the entered credentials match any of the registered librarians, the login is successful, and the login screen is replaced with the library management screen.

In the library management screen, there are several options available:

Add Book: Users can enter the title of a book they want to add to the library. Upon clicking the "Add Book" button, the book is added to the list of available books.

Remove Book: Users can enter the title of a book they want to remove from the library. Clicking the "Remove Book" button removes the book from the list of available books if it exists.

Issue Book: Users can enter the title of a book they want to issue. Clicking the "Issue Book" button checks if the book is available in the library and removes it from the list if it is. If the book is not available, an error message is displayed.

View Books: Clicking the "View Books" button displays a message box showing the list of available books in the library.
